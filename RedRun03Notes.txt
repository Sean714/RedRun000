TODO - wALLjUMP!
TODO - ADD DASH JUICE!


(Launch Character versus Timeline and set velocity??)

Tileset Actor for walls (for wall jump)

DASH:
Input Action IA_Dash
IMC - LMB
IA_Dash ->Do Once->Select(MovingRIght)->Launch
(XYOverride and ZOverride = TRUE)

Dash animations:
Use full sheet. (Done in 1?)

Wall Slide:
Event Hit -> Other actor -> Actor Has tag

Double Jump = setting in top of character hierarchy

Fix Exit jump and make Exit wallslide for sounds

Wall Jump:
In Jump, if wallsliding then launch.
Wallslide -> Branch -> Launch Character -> Slpit Pin, check xy & z overrides
Direction? Get Actor Forward Vector -> Multiply x by -1000
